# How to use Zora

Posting on Zora is a great way to share your art, projects, or ideas with the community and even monetize your creations. Here's how you can create a post and customize it with Zora’s features like pricing, splits, and collections.

#### **1. Setting Up Your Account**
- Make sure your account is verified with an email address. This is required to gain posting permissions. If you haven’t created an account yet, visit the [Zora website](https://zora.co) and follow the setup instructions.

#### **2. Creating a Post on the Zora App or Web Platform** 
- **On the App**: Tap the ➕ icon at the bottom of the screen, choose to take a new photo or select one from your gallery, and follow the prompts.
- **On the Web**: Log in, click on the **+** button in the top right corner, and set up your collection by filling out the provided form【43†source】【44†source】.

### **3. Organizing Content with Collections**
Each post you create starts as part of a collection. Think of collections as folders that help you categorize your work. You can create multiple collections, each starting with an **initial token**. Collections allow you to keep similar works grouped together, making it easier for your audience to navigate your creations.

### **4. Monetization Options: Setting a Price vs. Adding a Split**

#### **Setting a Price**
If you want to sell your post or any individual item within a collection, you can assign a fixed price in ETH. Setting a price means that anyone who wants to acquire the piece will need to pay the listed amount. This method works well for one-time sales and helps set clear value for your art.

#### **Adding a Split**
Alternatively, Zora offers a **Split** option, allowing multiple wallet addresses to share the revenue. Splits are a great way to distribute earnings between collaborators, sponsors, or communities. For example, you can set a percentage of your earnings to go directly to the **Gnars DAO wallet** (`0x72ad986ebac0246d2b3c565ab2a1ce3a14ce6f88`). This way, you support the broader skateboarding community with each sale.

#### **Earning Rewards**
In addition to direct sales, Zora’s **earn rewards** settings allow for flexible reward mechanisms. This can include shared royalties, incentives for holders, or special perks tied to NFT ownership. Choose this option if you want to reward your supporters over time rather than through a single sale.

### **5. Choosing the Right Blockchain**
While Zora supports multiple chains, we recommend using **Base** as your primary blockchain for the following reasons:

- **Lower Transaction Fees**: Base has significantly lower fees compared to Ethereum, making it cost-effective for creating and managing collections.
- **Easier Onboarding**: The Base network has user-friendly tools and integrations that make setting up new collections straightforward.
- **Network Compatibility**: Base is compatible with most Ethereum-based tools and contracts, offering the same security and flexibility.

### **6. Finalizing and Publishing Your Post**
- **Review**: Before posting, double-check your content, pricing, or split settings.
- **Publish**: Click **“Post”** and your content will be live. You can manage your posts through the dashboard, update metadata, or even add collaborators later on【45†source】.
