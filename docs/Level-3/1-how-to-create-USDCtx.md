## 4. You should see this page with the Contract ABI, but... 

> Sometimes it won't load so you can go to this [LINK](https://ipfs.skatehive.app/ipfs/QmaG3bJ59JcMHq4gyUrY8fjugve6DqCGYh8KQgBRwfTLzZ) copy everything in that page and paste it in that text box called Contract ABI

That will load all the contract functions in the next page. You are going to call a smart contract function! How exciting is that!

## 5. Select the **transfer** function

Paste the receiver address and the amount in dollars followed by 6 zeroes ($1234 USDC would be 1234000000)

Press **NEXT**

**USDC contract was set with 6 decimals so you need to put 6 zeros after the real amount (Come on Devs! You can do better!)

## Choose to also receive ETH or not 

I this case I will leave it empty and click **NEXT**
